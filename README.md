This repository is to document & collaborate of potential upcoming applications.

# Where are they?
Go to [discussions](https://github.com/coollabsio/ideas/discussions).

# Criterion
All apps should be:
- Free
- Open-source
- Self-hostable
- No feature behind paywall (if there would be a hosted version)
- Cool (important!)

# Why?
As I am ramen profitable with [Coolify](https://coolify.io) I realized that I should make more cool apps to help people.
