# Ideas 
Go to [discussions](https://github.com/coollabsio/ideas/discussions).

# Purpose
This repository is to document & collaborate of upcoming application ideas that should be:
- Free
- Fully open-source
- Easily self-hostable
- With no limitations (no feature behind paywall)

# Why?
As I am ramen profitable with [Coolify](https://coolify.io) I realized that I should make more cool apps to help people.
