This repository is for documenting and collaborating on potential upcoming applications.

# Where are they?
Go to [discussions](https://github.com/coollabsio/ideas/discussions).

# Requirements
All apps should be:

- Free
- Open-source
- Self-hostable
- No features behind paywalls (if a hosted version exists)
- Cool (this is important!)

# Why?
Since [Coolify](https://coolify.io?ref=coollabsideas) became ramen profitable, I've realized I should create more cool apps to help people.
